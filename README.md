# QR Code Generator

This repository contains a Python script and a Jupyter notebook for generating QR codes using the qrcode and image libraries.
It takes URL as input and downloads the image into your folder.

QR codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can be easily scanned by smartphones and other devices, allowing you to quickly encode and decode various types of information.
